## Project status 

   Project is in very early stage, we are still missing some essential classes. 
   We are aiming to have close to completely defined base classes by our next meeting 
   on 13.11.2023 and ideally (albeit perhaps naively optimistically) we would produce an
   early version of executable game during our next meeting. 

### TODOs

   Same as in the 'Actions' section.
